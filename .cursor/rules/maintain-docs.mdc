- when starting a task, read the docs/index.md file to see if there are relevant docs, and read them if so.
- when changing the configuration, update any relevant documentation files, including the index.md if there
  are new files or substantial chamges.
- when I correct you on something or something you try doesn't work, suggest to me a documentation file you
  could update (or write) to avoid the misunderstanding in the future.
