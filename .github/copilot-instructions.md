When writing code or config,
- prefer short code.
- Do not restate defaults unless they are very important for the operation.
- do not build "just in case" customizability; prefer a single path and simplicity.

When working with infrastructure as code,
- All changes to the system should be applied through IaC via the github workflows.
- use CLI and imperative tools for debugging but not to make changes.
- do not apply anything without my explicit permission.
