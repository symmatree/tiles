# Secret Management

Secrets are (almost) all stored in a 1Password vault dedicated to this cluster.

## Initial Secrets

Many secrets are generated by the `tf/bootstrap` bundle, which creates service accounts
and restricted tokens where it can. However some are created manually:

* `tiles-onepassword-sa` which is a full 1Password service account with read-write
  access to the relevant vault. Note that this would allow privilege escalation (read becomes write), and
  should probably live in a separate privileged vault.
* `github-vpn-client` with a `notesPlain` with a Wireguard config in it
* `morpheus-terraform` with a `terraform` service account creds for the Unifi
* `proxmox-root` with a `root` service account for the Proxmox cluster
* `github-tiles-tf-bootstrap` with a Github PAT token granting read-write access
  to lots of Github assets on the containing repo.
* `tiles-machine-secrets` (or `tiles-test-machine-secrets` for test environment) - Talos machine secrets

## Talos Machine Secrets

Talos machine secrets must be created manually before deploying a new cluster. This is done manually because:

1. **Terraform cannot be used**:** The Terraform Talos provider's `talos_machine_secrets` resource generates secrets, but Talos is unable to load the resulting files. The root cause of this incompatibility is not fully understood.

2. **Script generation is avoided**: We intentionally do not generate secrets in `apply-talos-config.sh` to prevent accidental regeneration, which would break existing clusters.

### Manual Creation Process

For a new cluster, generate and store the secrets as follows:

1. Generate the secrets file locally:

   ```bash
   talosctl gen secrets --output-file /tmp/secrets.yaml
   ```

2. Create an empty 1Password item with the correct name:
   * For production: `tiles-machine-secrets`
   * For test: `tiles-test-machine-secrets`

   Create it as a Secure Note in the `tiles-secrets` vault (or appropriate vault for your environment).

3. Populate the item with the generated secrets:

   ```bash
   op item edit \
     --vault tiles-secrets \
     tiles-machine-secrets \
     notesPlain="$(cat /tmp/secrets.yaml)"
   ```

4. Clean up the temporary file:

   ```bash
   rm /tmp/secrets.yaml
   ```

**Important**: These secrets are cluster-specific and must never be regenerated for an existing cluster. The `apply-talos-config.sh` script will reuse existing secrets from 1Password.

### GitHub App

GitHub authentication is now done via a GitHub App which generates short-lived tokens automatically:

* `github-app-tiles-tf` - GitHub App credentials (App ID, Installation ID, PEM key)

The GitHub App generates installation tokens (1 hour lifespan) programmatically for:

* Terraform provider authentication (manages repo configuration)
* Grafana data source (read-only access to repo metrics)

**See [GitHub App Setup Guide](./github-app-setup.md) for detailed documentation on:**
* Creating and configuring the GitHub App
* Token generation and automatic refresh
* Automatic propagation to Kubernetes via 1Password Operator
* Troubleshooting and key rotation

## Runtime / Github Actions

Github has a single secret, `ONEPASSWORD_SA_TOKEN`, which allows a workflow to call
the 1Password load secrets action, which gives it access to the rest (including a github
PAT).

## Local Terraform `tf/bootstrap`

The `bootstrap` bundle requires secrets to be injected, and recovers the rest from
the 1Password vault:

```
eval $(op signon)
export TF_VAR_onepassword_sa_token=$(op read op://tiles-secrets/tiles-onepassword-sa/credential)
export TF_VAR_github_app_id=$(op read op://tiles-secrets/github-app-tiles-tf/app_details/app_id)
export TF_VAR_github_app_installation_id=$(op read op://tiles-secrets/github-app-tiles-tf/app_details/installation_id)
export TF_VAR_github_app_pem_file=$(op read op://tiles-secrets/github-app-tiles-tf/password)
terraform plan
```
